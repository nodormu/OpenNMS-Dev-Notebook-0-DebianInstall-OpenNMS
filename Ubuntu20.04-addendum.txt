Ubuntu 20.04 notes:  Dependency issue and syslog repo updates.

1) The only issues I ran into with the install script are in regards to a specific dependency as shown below.

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 opennms-common : Depends: libgetopt-mixed-perl but it is not installable
                  Recommends: libnet-snmp-perl but it is not going to be installed
                  Recommends: libxml2-utils
 opennms-minion : Conflicts: opennms-minion-container (< 25.0.0) but 24.1.3-1 is to be installed
                  Conflicts: opennms-minion-features-core (< 25.0.0) but 24.1.3-1 is to be installed
                  Conflicts: opennms-minion-features-default (< 25.0.0) but 24.1.3-1 is to be installed
 opennms-remote-poller : Conflicts: opennms-server but 26.1.1-1 is to be installed

I was able to download the dependency here with a wget command and use dpkg to install it.

https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/perl/libgetopt-mixed-perl

Click on the 'all' link, and it will take you to the most recent page of mirrors to download the dependency.

2) Install syslog repo for latest greatest syslog-ng repo. See command below.
If you don't use Ubuntu, then go to the URL in the wget and find the path for your version of linux.
Also don't forget the space and the - at the end of add. The text trails off the view.

wget -qO - http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/laszlo_budai:/syslog-ng/xUbuntu_20.04/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -

3) Create a file in the following directory.
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syslog-ng-obs.list

4) Add this to the file and save it.
deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/laszlo_budai:/syslog-ng/xUbuntu_20.04 ./

5) Run update/upgrade. If syslog is installed, it will update.
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt-get autoremove -y

6) If syslog-ng is not installed, install it.
sudo apt-get install syslog-ng-core -y
