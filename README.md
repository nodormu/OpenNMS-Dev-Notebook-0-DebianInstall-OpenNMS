This is a step by step instruction set for installing OpenNMS on Debian based Linux systems.
I chose to use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server.
The original installation includes the iptables installation and rulebase.
I decided to add a separate document for migration instead of altering the original documentation.
Once iptables is completely EOL/EOS, I'll updated the primary instructions.
